Welcome to "Life on Earth" Documentary!!

In this documentary we will explore how life on earth was 65 million years ago; when dinosaurs went extinct because of an Asteroid impact event
Then we will move to the future (2020) to see how life on earth has changed !  The project is implemented using cs1graphics library!

Instructions
In order to run the main file (Earth.py) correctly you need to :
1.Install cs1graphics library to your python path files
2.Install playsound library to your python path files (playsound.py is attached)
3.Sounds are uploaded in the main file, its important to download them, then change the path to the files in (Earth.py)
to be able to import them correctly to the code.
For example
My code: playsound.playsound('C:/Users/Haneen/Desktop/needed files/Backwards Souls.mp3', True)
Your code should be: playsound.playsound('YOUR Path/Backwards Souls.mp3', True)
4.Please Turn up your speakers volume
5.Now you are ready to run the code.
